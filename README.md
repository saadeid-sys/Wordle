# Wordle

This is a simple Wordle game GUI app written in Java using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The app is designed to allow a player to guess a secret word by inputting a guess and receiving feedback on which letters are correct and in the correct position.

## How to Play

Run the Main.java file to launch the game.
The game will start with a blank input field and a button to submit the guess.
Enter a guess of 5 letters (lowercase letters only) into the input field and click the "Guess" button.
The game will provide feedback on the guess by showing which letters are correct and in the correct position with a green circle and which letters are correct but in the wrong position with a yellow circle.
Keep guessing until the secret word is revealed or until you have exhausted all 10 attempts.
If the secret word is revealed, a message will be displayed congratulating the player.
To start a new game, click the "New Game" button.
